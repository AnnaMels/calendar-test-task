## ðŸ“… Calendar App

I created a calendar using the **[FullCalendar](https://fullcalendar.io/)** library.  
This is a minimally working solution - I focused on achieving the desired **functionality** and **appearance**, but the code still needs some **refactoring**.

The provided mockup (from technical task) didnâ€™t include visuals for some requirements, so I added my own versions to preserve the necessary features. I didnâ€™t use any additional libraries and instead implemented my own (somewhat tricky) calculations for positioning the popup.

 **Key Points**
- Built with **FullCalendar**.
- Custom popup positioning logic
- Mockup-inspired design with my own additions for missing parts.
- Functionality prioritized - refactoring planned.
